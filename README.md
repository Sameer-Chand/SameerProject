## ✨ Features

- 📂 **Read CSV Data** – Load student performance dataset.
- ➕ **Calculate Total Score** – Sum of Math, Reading, and Writing scores.
- 🏅 **Assign Grades** based on total score:
  
  | Grade | Score Range |
  |-------|-------------|
  | 🅰️ A  | 250+         |
  | 🅱️ B  | 200–249     |
  | 🇨 C  | 150–199     |
  | 🇩 D  | 100–149     |
  | ❌ F  | Below 100   |

- 📊 **Data Analysis**:
  - Summary statistics
  - Grade distribution counts
  - Missing value check

- 📈 **Data Visualizations**:
  - Histograms of subject scores
  - Boxplots: Gender vs Scores
  - Pie chart of grade distribution
  - Correlation heatmap
  - Bar chart: Test Preparation vs Average Score
