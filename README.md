ðŸŽ“ Student Grade Analysis
This project takes a Students Performance dataset, calculates total scores, assigns grades, and visualizes the results with beautiful charts.
Itâ€™s simple, beginner-friendly, and a great example of Pandas + Matplotlib + Seaborn usage.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Read CSV data about students' performance.

Calculate total score for each student.

Assign grades based on score ranges:

A â†’ 250+

B â†’ 200â€“249

C â†’ 150â€“199

D â†’ 100â€“149

F â†’ Below 100

Data Analysis:

Summary statistics

Grade counts

Missing value check

Data Visualization:

Histograms of subject scores

Boxplots comparing gender vs scores

Pie chart of grade distribution

Correlation heatmap

Bar chart: Test preparation vs average score

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The project uses the StudentsPerformance.csv dataset.
Each row contains:

Gender

Math Score

Reading Score

Writing Score

Test Preparation Course status
